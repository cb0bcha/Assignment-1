Assumptions
1. Calculator expects the user inputs in meters
2. For better accuracy, velocity should be calculated at the mid of each section at 0.6*depth to compensate ground friction.
3. Calculator rejects the user inputs if number of sections are less than 5. It auto populates Interval field based on minimum 5 sections.
4. Calculator rejects the user inputs if number of sections are more than 200. 
5. Depth measurement needs to be taken at equal intervals.
6. Each section is considered as trapezoid.
7. Application uses double (8-bytes) instead of float (4-bytes) which is supported specially by compiler.
8. Application uses interations over recursions for calculations
9. Code comments are not added to improve code-readability.
